    <div class="fullContainer">
        <p> Have you ever delivered something that didn't solve your customer's problems? Trust me, Iâ€™ve been there! To
            trully understand your cusomters, you have to do the research, test your hypothesis and test again. It isn't
            enough to pick and choose the types of insights tht you gather. In order to really understand, you need to
            step through each piece of the design thinking process and connect those dots to learn what your customers
            really want! </p>

    <div class="fullContainer">
        <p>I can help you turn your vision into reality by really getting to know your customers through thorough user
            research. That research is used to create prototypes that can be used to test out hypothesis and features to
            see what your customers really want.</p>
