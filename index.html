    <div class="fullContainer" id="aboutMeGridArea">
        <p>Have you ever delivered something that didn’t solve your customer’s problems? Trust me, I’ve been there!
            It is so hard to spend months working on a solution to only discover that it isn’t what was really needed.
            After soul searching, I realized that the biggest reasons why things weren’t perfect was because shortcuts
            were taken during the design process. It is so important to connect all of the dots together to really
            understand what your customer wants, is motivated by and what they really need.</p>

    <div class="sectionHead">My Story</div>
    <div class="partialRightContainer" id="aboutMeGridArea" id="flexContainer">
        <div row>
            <p>I’m always connecting the dots. I spent my entire career making sure that needs are met and that everyone
                is
                on the same page. Whether it was as a developer or product manager, I made sure I understood what the
                customer needed. As a Customer Insight/Customer Experience leader, I lived to make sure I had a real
                picture
                of the customer and what they needed. My certification as a UI/UX Designer just solidifies what I have
                always done - connect those dots into reality!</p>
